# Recursion

## Recursive Function

Recursive function is a function that calls itself. It is a technique in which a function makes one or more calls to itself.

> Note
> - Recursive function must have a base case to stop the recursion.
> - Whenever a recursive function calls itself, it must be with different arguments and nearly to stop the recursion.

## Example of Recursive Function

1. Factorial
2. Fibonacci
